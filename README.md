# A High-Performance Response-Based Cryptography Engine on the GPU

This project is an adaptation of an OpenMP version of RBC created by Christopher Philabaum.

The RBC engine utilizes an AES algorithm developed in the following paper:  
A High-Performance Side-Channel-Resistant AES on GPUs, paper published in GPGPU'19.
